# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We currently don't have online multiplayer publically available,
therefor security isn't a major issue nor a priority right now.

Online multiplayer is being designed p2p style (peer-to-peer), so
for a while, security will be rather bad until we fully focus on it.
